# Don't Poke the Bear

The [old repository](https://github.com/Zbeyer/BearPoke) wont get any updates or bug fixes. I migrated the project from TS to JS and may have introduced some regressions along the way. This version is intended to be distributed via [Itch.io](https://zbeyer.itch.io/bearpoke)

## Testing

This project assumes you have `serve` on your computer

Unix developers can install serve:

```bash
npm install -g serve
```

To start a web server use the command:

```
serve -p 9000
```
